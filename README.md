# Instacart
## Using Jupyter notebook in Python for data analysis
##### Overview
This project was based on another online company, this time a grocery store company called Instacart. Quite similar to Rockbuster but Instacart was more specific on the behavioural attributes of her customers when it came to ordering habits. Ordering habit patterns needed to be deciphered, established and presented to management to help make high level marketing decisions.
